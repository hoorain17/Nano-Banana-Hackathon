![DisasterGuard Banner](https://github.com/hoorain17/Nano-Banana-Hackathon/blob/main/Gemini_Generated_Image_eszzhoeszzhoeszz.png)  

## 📌 Project Overview  
**DisasterGuard** is a flood early-warning system designed for vulnerable rural communities. Using AI, real-time data, and predictive modeling, DisasterGuard delivers **timely alerts** to families via mobile devices, enabling them to evacuate safely before disaster strikes.  

This project was developed for the **Google Nano Banana Hackathon** with the goal of creating a solution that is **practical, community-driven, and life-saving**.

## 🎥 Demo Video  
We created a powerful storytelling video to illustrate the impact:  

- **Scene 1:** A little girl and her baby goat are caught in a sudden flood — tragedy strikes.  
- **Scene 2:** With DisasterGuard, her father receives an early alert. The family evacuates in time, saving both the girl and her goat.

## 📖 Storyboard

- We used an emotional narrative to demonstrate the importance of DisasterGuard.
- Before DisasterGuard: Families have no warning → lives lost.
- With DisasterGuard: Families receive alerts → they evacuate safely.
- The story was crafted to touch hearts and show impact beyond technology.

## 🌱 Impact
DisasterGuard is not just a hackathon project — it’s a vision for climate resilience in developing countries:

- Protecting lives of vulnerable children & families
- Reducing livestock and property losses
- Empowering communities with trust in technology

## 📌 Future Work

- Integrate satellite-based flood prediction models
- Add multilingual voice alerts for non-literate communities
- Develop a mobile app (Android) for offline-first access
- Partner with NGOs and governments for field deployment
